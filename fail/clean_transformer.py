"""# Understanding Inputs & Outputs of a Transformer

## What is the point of a transformer?

**Transformers exist to model text!**

We're going to focus GPT-2 style transformers. Key feature: They generate text! You feed in language, and the model generates a probability distn over tokens. And you can repeatedly sample from this to generate text!

### How is the model trained?

You give it a bunch of text, and train it to predict the next token.

Importantly, if you give a model 100 tokens in a sequence, it predicts the next token for *each* prefix, ie it produces 100 predictions. This is kinda weird but it's much easier to make one that does this. And it also makes training more efficient, because you can 100 bits of feedback rather than just one.

#### Objection: Isn't this trivial for the first 99?

No! We make the transformer have *causal attention*. The core thing is that it can only move information forwards in the sequence. The prediction of what comes after token 50 is only a function of the first 50 tokens, *not* of token 51. (Jargon: *autoregressive*)

### Key takeaway:

Transformers are *sequence modelling engines*. It does the same processing in parallel at each sequence position, can move information between positions with attention, and conceptually can take a sequence of arbitrary length (not actually true, see later)

## Tokens - Transformer Inputs

Core point: Input is language (ie a sequence of characters, strings, etc)

### How do we convert language to vectors?

ML models take in vectors, not weird shit like language - how do we convert?

#### Idea: integers to vectors

We basically make a lookup table. Called an embedding. 

Jargon: **One-hot encoding** We map eg numbers from 1 to 100, to a 100-dim vector, with a 1 in the kth position, 0 everywhere else. Key intuition is that one-hot encodings let you think about each integer independently - useful when integers = labels. 

Dimensions = things that vary independently. Each input has its own dimension, so each input can be thought of independently, we don't bake in any relation.

Lookup tables <=> Multiply a fixed matrix by the one-hot encoded vector.

### Tokens: Language to sequence of integers

Core idea: We need a model that can deal with arbitrary text. We want to convert this into integers, *and* we want these integers to be in a bounded range. 

**Idea:** Form a vocabulary!

**Idea 1:** Get a dictionary! 

**Problem:** It can't cope with arbitrary text (eg URLs, punctuation, etc) Can't cope with mispellings.

**Idea 2:** Vocab = 256 ASCII characters. Fixed vocab size, can do arbitrary text, etc.

**Problem:** Loses structure of language - some sequences of characters are more meaningful than others.

Eg "language" is a lot more meaningful than "hjksdfiu" - we want the first to be a single token, second to not be. It's a more efficient use of our vocab.

#### What Actually Happens?

This super cursed thing called Byte-Pair Encodings

Ä  ~ means begins with a space, tokens with a leading space vs not are different.

We begin with the 256 ASCII characters as our tokens, and then find the most common pair of tokens, and merge that into a new token. Eg " t" is the most common pair, so it's our next token! Repeat 50000 times...

"""### Key Takeaway:

* We learn a dictionary of vocab of tokens (sub-words).

* We (approx) losslessly convert language to integers via tokenizing it.

* We convert integers to vectors via a lookup table.

* Note: input to the transformer is a sequence of *tokens* (ie integers), not vectors

## Logits - Transformer Outputs

**Goal:** Probability distribution over next tokens. (for every *prefix* of the sequence - given n tokens, we make n next token predictions)

**Problem:** How to convert a vector to a probability distribution? 

**Answer:** Use a softmax ($x_i \to \frac{e^{x_i}}{\sum e^{x_j}}$), exponential makes everything positive, normalization makes it add to one.

So the model outputs a tensor of logits, one vector of size $d_{vocab}$ for each input token.

We can use this to generate things!

"""## Key takeaways:

* Takes in language, predicts next token (for *each* token in a causal way)
* We convert language to a sequence of integers with a tokenizer.
* We convert integers to vectors with a lookup table.

* Output is a vector of logits (one for each input token), we convert to a probability distn with a softmax, and can then convert this to a token (eg taking the largest logit, or sampling).

* We append this to the input + run again to generate more text (Jargon: *autoregressive*)

* Meta level point: Transformers are sequence operation models, they take in a sequence, do processing in parallel at each position, and use attention to move information between positions!

High-Level architecture:

Go watch my [Transformer Circuits walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV5gbOmHbjU) if you want more intuitions!

(Diagram is bottom to top)

* Input tokens, integers
* Embedding is a lookup table mapping tokens to vectors
    * Lives in the *residual stream*
* Residual stream - the sum of all previous outputs of layers of the model, is the input to each new layer.
    * *Really* fundamental. It's the central object of the transformer.
        * It's how model remembers things, moves information between layers for composition, and it's the medium used to store the information that attention moves between positions.
* Then we have a series of $n_{layers}$ transformer blocks
    * Confusing jargon - a block contains an attention layer *and* an MLP layer, but we say a transformer has k layers if it has k blocks (ie 2k total layers).
* First we have attention. This moves information from prior positions in the sequence to the current token. 
    * We do this for *every* token in parallel using the same parameters. The only difference is that we look backwards only, so later tokens get more room to look back.
        * We look backwards so we can predict the next token without cheating.
    * Only bit of a transformer that moves information between positions.
    * Made up of $n_heads$ heads - each with their own parameters, own attention pattern, and own information how to copy things from source to destination.
        * The heads act independently and additively, we just add their outputs together, and back to the stream
    * Each head:
        * Produces an attention pattern for each destination token, a probability distribution of prior source tokens (including the current one) weighting how much information to copy.
            * Do this for each pair of tokens
            * Copy information in the same way from each source token.
                * What information we copy *does* depend on the source token's *residual stream*. This does not necessarily mean the info of what text token is at the source token's position
                * Copy = apply a linear map.
        * Fundamental point: Figuring out *which* source tokens to copy info from is a separate circuit from figuring out *how* to copy that information.
        * Internal head dimension of $d_{head} = \frac{d_{model}}{n_{heads}}
* MLP Layers - standard neural network. Single hidden layer, linear map -> GELU activation -> linear map
    * Exact activation not conceptually important.
    * Middle dimension normally $d_{mlp} = 4 \times d_{model}$
        * Exactly why the ratios are what they are isn't super important - doesn't matter that much, people basically cargo-cult GPT did.
    * Intuition - once attention has moved relevant information to a single position in the residual stream, MLPs can actually do computation, reasoning, lookup information, etc.
        * Big open problem in transformer mechanistic interpretability is what is going on inside MLPs?! See [Toy Model of Superposition Paper](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/toy_model/index.html) for more on why this is hard.
        * Underlying intuition - linear map -> non-linearity -> linear map is the most powerful force in the universe and can approximate arbitrary functions. Idk man it just works
* Finally, we unembed!
    * Apply a linear map, going from final residual stream to a vector of logits - this is the output.

### Bonus things - less conceptually important but key technical details
* LayerNorm
    * Simple normalization function applied at the start of each layer - MLP, Attn and Unembed
    * Converts each input vector (independently in parallel for each batch x position residual stream vector) to have mean zero and variance 1.
    * Then applies an elementwise scaling and translation
    * Cool maths tangent: The scale & translate is just a linear map. LayerNorm is only applied immediately before another linear map. Linear compose linear = linear, so we can just fold this into a single effective linear layer and ignore it.
        * `fold_ln=True` flag in `from_pretrained` does this for you.
    * LayerNorm is super fucking annoying, because the scale part is not linear, so you can't think about different bits of the input independently. But it's *almost* linear - if you're changing a small part of the input it's linear, but if you're changing enough to alter the norm substantially it's not linear :(
* Positional Information
    * This is totally fucked and messy, sorry!
    * **Problem:** Attention operates over all pairs of positions. This means it's symmetric with regards to position - the attention calculation from token 5 to token 1 and token 5 to token 2 are the same by default
        * This is dumb because nearby tokens are more relevant.
    * There's a lot of dumb hacks for this.
    * We'll focus on **learned, absolute positional embeddings**. This means we learn a lookup table mapping the index of the position of each token to a residual stream vector, and add this to the embed.
        * Note that we *add* rather than concatenate. This is because the residual stream is shared memory, and likely under significant superposition (the model compresses more features in there than the model has dimensions)
        * We basically never concatenate inside a transformer, unless doing weird shit like generating text efficiently.

It has bronze underparts with a brown groin and back of the thigh, cream upperparts with brown flecking, a dark brown side of the head, and a red iris. On the hind feet, the first toe is absent and the second and fifth toes are strongly reduced. The frog is known only from the Sainte Luce Reserve, where it inhabits areas with deep leaf litter near semi-permanent water bodies. Specimens of frogs from Mandena, the Vohimena mountains, the southern Anosy Mountains, and Tsitongambarika may also be of this species. Along with Mini mum and Mini ature, the other two species in its genus, it received media attention when first described due to the wordplay in its scientific name. (Full article...)"""

This is a lightweight demonstration of how you can actually train your own GPT-2 with this code! Here we train a tiny model on a tiny dataset, but it's fundamentally the same code for training a larger/more real model (though you'll need beefier GPUs and data parallelism to do it remotely efficiently, and fancier parallelism for much bigger ones).

For our purposes, we'll train 2L 4 heads per layer model, with context length 256, for 1000 steps of batch size 8, just to show what it looks like (and so the notebook doesn't melt your colab lol).
